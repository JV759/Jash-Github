- `dim_rooms.csv`: Room-related information  
- `fact_aggregated_bookings.csv`: Aggregated booking data  
- `fact_bookings.csv`: Detailed booking records  

## **Key Tasks**  
- Data exploration and cleaning to ensure integrity.  
- Identification of trends such as overbookings, top-performing properties, and anomalies.  
- Removal of outliers to refine analysis accuracy.

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python**: Primary programming language  
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive coding environment  

## **Project Outcomes**  
The analysis provided critical insights into booking patterns, property performance, and operational anomalies, offering value for business optimization in the hospitality domain.
